## Overview
Vehicle Builder is a back-end application designed for creating and managing various types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and motorcycles. Users can also choose from three pre-made vehicles available in the app. This application allows you to drive, accelerate, decelerate, perform wheelies, and tow other vehicles, all while maintaining logical interactions.
